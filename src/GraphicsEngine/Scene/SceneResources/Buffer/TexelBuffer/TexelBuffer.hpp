/**
 * Texel buffers are used for image-like data, so there should be significant overlap between these two classes.
 *
 * However, I'm thinking maybe these can kind of behave like VertexBuffers, in that they're templated - maybe instead of
 * being the vertex type it could potentially be the format or something? But I'm not sure, that may be better if it came
 * from the creation input or something - I'm not really sure how we're going to handle the hundreds of possible formats.
 *
 * If it comes down to it I'll implement a big wrapper class that you just supply certain aspects of the format thru enums,
 * eg "R, RG, RGB..." for the number of dimensions per pixel, the number of bits per coordinate, and the specific type info
 * of the pixel values (eg normalized, unnormalized, unsigned, etc)
 *
 * At least if I did it that way it would be able to be shared between these classes and the image.
 *
 * BIG OTHER THING I JUST REMEMBERED - you basically treat these as sampled images in your shaders; this class will need
 * to follow the example of Texture as well
 *
 * Another note: you can have uniform and storage texel buffers; make that a configuration setting
